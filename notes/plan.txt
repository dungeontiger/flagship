basic sensors

chance to detect is based on target distance and mass
% detect = Optimum range / range^2 * mass / optium mass ( - target modifiers )

units:

tonnes	mass
km	distance
MW	power
km/min	speed
km/min^2	acceleration
MJ	energy (damage, shields)
MN	thrust
min time

need a full class to manage a ship, not just json
